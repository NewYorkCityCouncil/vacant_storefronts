# Storefronts Reported Vacant or Not

### Analyzing Storefront Vacancies

New York City can be a challenging place for small businesses to operate. In addition to adhering to occasionally complex regulatory schemes enforced by multiple City agencies, business owners confront hurdles including rising rents, taxation, competition from chain stores and e-commerce retailers, and various zoning restrictions. Over the course of the last year, a slew of beloved local establishments across the city closed amid skyrocketing costs.

Local Law 157 of 2019 seeks to gather data about the state of vacant storefronts to conduct the sort of studies needed to understand the full scope of storefront vacancy in New York City. The bill requires the department of finance to collect data and establish a public dataset of commercial properties in the City.

The data team analyzed local law 57 data in order to:
- Assess the severity of the problem 
- Identify vacant storefront hotspots 
- Release recommendations for better reporting

You can read our takeaways and recommendations [on the council website](https://council.nyc.gov/data/vacant-storefronts/). The initial analysis was performed for the NYC Council's 6.9.22 ['Oversight - Combatting Commercial Vacancies'](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/MeetingDetail.aspx?From=Alert&ID=980028&GUID=239563C5-9CA2-44A7-8E1D-A970A0556192) hearing.

## FAQ

#### Where can I find the storefront vacancy data?
You can find the [Storefronts Reported Vacant or Not](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Storefronts-Reported-Vacant-or-Not/92iy-9c3n) dataset on the NYC Open Data portal. 

#### Who maintains the dataset and what is Local Law 157?
In 2019, the New York City Council passed a bill requiring building owners of ground-floor and second-floor commercial premises to submit to the Department of Finance (DOF) registration statements. From those statements, the DOF collects data on commercial properties, including whether or not those properties are vacant. They are required to publish this data to the NYC Open Data portal every year or every six months if owners filed a supplemental registration statement.

You can find more details about the bill [here](https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3877885&GUID=C0D2361D-766A-42E3-A5CD-F8DBB1C52E8B&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=157).

#### What is the storefront vacancy data about?
As described on the Open Data Portal, “Each row shows a storefront that was registered with the department as of December 31 of the reporting year and legally required updates provided as of June 30 (or date sold if earlier) of the calendar year immediately following the reporting year. Each row contains the property's borough, block and lot number and the storefront's street address (and zip code), either field can be used to search for individual storefronts.”

#### How often is the data updated?
The data is updated every year. You can report an error or questions about the dataset on the open data portal by filling out the form [here](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/engage/).

#### How is vacancy defined?
Where a commercial storefront "in a designated class one property that has not been leased to a tenant for any time period during the twelve months preceding the January 1st of the current calendar year" or "if the premises becomes vacant at any time during the period from January 1 through June 30 of the current calendar year or the ownership of the premises has changed during that period." - Local Law 157 

#### What are the important nuances of the dataset?
*Data is self-reported:*
All data is based on the information registered with the DOF. Data about the occupancy or vacancy status for each storefront rely solely on the information provided in the registration. 

*There are two periods of time for which owners of commercial storefronts must report vacancies:*
1. Owners can either report yes the storefront was reported vacant on 12/31 of the reporting year or no the storefront was reported owner-occupied or leased on 12/31 of the reporting year.
2. Required for Classes 2 and 4 and optional for Class 1 storefront properties, owners after the 12/31 reporting year, can report yes the storefront was reported vacant on 6/30 or the date the property was sold if earlier than 6/30. Blank means there is no reported information.
